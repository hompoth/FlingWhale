# Eleforce / Fling Whale
A small project I made to work on dynamic maps generated by seed values. 
Has working multiplayer and path generation.

Text.exe is the executable.

Navigate with path generation with:  
/goto x, y    --  Move towards position x, y   
/stop         --  Stop moving  
/clear        --  Clear current generated path  
/wander       --  Move about randomly  
/pursuit      --  Pursuit the nearest other player  
/evade        --  Evade from the nearest other player
